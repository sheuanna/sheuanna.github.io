						<h1>Great products: Venmo</h1>

					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

		<p>The first time I had heard about Venmo was in 2015 when I moved to the United States. I was having dinner with a few friends and we were trying to figure out how to split the bill when one said “I’ll care of it, just Venmo me”. That evening I downloaded Venmo and was amazed at how easy it made consumer peer-to-peer payments. I have not touched my bank money transfer, physical cash, or PayPal account since.</p>
		<p>Before I dig into why I believe Venmo is a great product I’ll establish a framework to broadly assess products from an outsider’s perspective (as in without knowing performance metrics such as DAUs, MAUs, revenues, etc.). I believe there are three key areas to a product:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Technical</b>: how does it solve the user problem? Does it solve it more quickly, affordably, and / or conveniently for the user?</li>
				<li><b>User experience</b>: how easy is the product to use? Is the product experience tailored for its target audience?
				<li><b>Business model and ecosystem</b>: how does the product make money? Who are the customer segments the product is made for? Is the product linked to a broader ecosystem of products and services to offer an integrated experience?
			</ul>

		<p>I also believe great products are outstanding in at least two of three areas. Examples:</p>
			<p><b>Google Search</b>: delivered a superior technical solution (more relevant search results faster) and a streamlined user experience. Google also eventually developed a viable revenue model and surrounding ecosystem to create a competitive moat. To this day Google Search is still superior in all three areas (technical, user experience, business model and ecosystem).</p>
			<p><b>Apple iPhone</b>: defined itself on its design and user experience - it was simple to use, aesthetically pleasing, and delivered what the user wanted before the user knew it. The iPhone was also integrated into the Apple ecosystem thus increasing switching costs. While other phones available had similar technical features at similar or lower price points, Apple knew its target customer and designed for them.</p>
			<p><b>Amazon Kindle</b>: while not overwhelming superior in any aspect, being very strong in all three areas makes the Kindle a great product. Kindle knew the target user and designed the product for them, delivering the features they wanted (e.g. long battery life, screen optimized for reducing eye strain), a simple end-to-end user experience from purchase to reading, and supported by the Amazon Kindle store and linked to the broader e-commerce site.</p>
			
		<h2>What makes Venmo great</h2>
		<p>Similar to the three products mentioned above, I’ll break down why Venmo is a great product by the three areas.</p>
		
		<h3>Technical</h3>
		<p>Venmo hits all the tablestakes technical elements of a peer-to-peer payment solution. Venmo complies with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), which was created by a group that includes Visa, MasterCard and American Express to provide multiple layers of protection for digital financial transactions. Venmo has a 
			24-hour fraud-and-risk-protection teams and will let you PIN-protect the app.</p>
		<p>The app is reliable and is available on iOs and Android, which at the time of its launch was not true of its competitors (e.g. Google Wallet). Finally the app allows for money transfer into your bank account within 3 days.</p>
		
		<h3>User experience</h3>
		<p>The user experience is what differentiates Venmo. The simple design makes it very straightforward and intuitive to discover how to use the app. Compared to existing solutions such as bank transfers, PayPal, and paying in cash the user experience for Venmo is seamless.</p>
			<p><b>Onboarding</b>: the ease of setting up the app as well as integration with Facebook to have access to social contacts makes onboarding onto Venmo simple and painless. Key steps include identification authentication either through your SIN number or Facebook, and linking to a debit or credit card</p>
			<p><b>Payments</b>: paying someone back is equally simple. You type in their username, the amount, and press pay / charge.</p>
		
		<h3>Business model and ecosystem</h3>
		<p>While Venmo does not have an ecosystem of other linked offerings supporting it or building a competitive moat, it differentiates by creating its own ecosystem. With the rise of social sharing, the newsfeed works well with Venmo’s target (or initial target) user, millennials. By creating a newsfeed of payments Venmo has created a feature that is differentiated from its competitors and gives users a reason to check Venmo besides payments, making it an app that isn’t just for occasional use.</p>
		<p>While other competitors are entering the market such as Facebook, Venmo being a standalone app focused on payments combined with easy to use privacy tools gives users a greater sense of comfort over their privacy. Furthermore Venmo has a lead on the payments market thus increasing switch costs for their target to other payment platforms.</p>		
		<p>Finally Venmo’s business model is appropriate for the millennial users it is targeting. With a 2.9% fees on transactions funded with a credit card and free debit card transactions, peer-to-peer payments can essentially be free for the user. While there are definite weaknesses in the financial viability of the model and Venmo likely needs to move into new customer segments (e.g. small businesses) or unveil features that would generate revenue (e.g. payment in foreign currencies), the current business model is aligned at the target user.</p>
		
		<h3>Wrap up</h3>
		<p>Venmo’s simplicity of sending peer-to-peer payments, social features, and business model are all tailored for its target user. It is a great product because it has created a reliable social payments ecosystem based on a user experience that is superior to existing competition.</p>
