						<h1>Startup founders - lessons from the top 100 IPOs of the last decade</h1>

			<!-- /.row -->

			<p>Venture capitalists and successful startup founders have emphasized that who you choose as co-founders is more important than the idea itself. In general two co-founders is the most ideal, with three sometimes being better. 
			To support this claim, I examined the <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/tech-ipos/#filter/ageipo/10">the IPOs of the 100 most valuable companies</a> that have gone public in the last decade to determine if there were patterns in number of co-founders, backgrounds of founders, and where these co-founders met.</p>
			
			<h2>1. How many founders is ideal?</h2>

			<p>The data shows that the vast majority of companies (89%) have 1-3 founders with two being the most prevalent. One piece of information that would be critical to be able to conclude that two (or three in some cases) is ideal is the startup success rate by number of founders (e.g. IPOs by one / two / three founders, 
			divided by total number of companies started by one / two / three founders). In terms of value creation companies with one founder had the highest IPO and current day values, however there are likely too many factors (e.g. industry of company, year of IPO) to correlate number of founders and value creation.</p>
